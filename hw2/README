************************CSCI-E295 - Homework 2: Parser******************************

This source code compiles into a parser for a subset of the C language. It can read input from stdin or optionally from a file. It constructs a parse tree for grammatical input, or emits an error for ungrammatical input. For grammatical input, it also prints the input with added parentheses and indentation that illustrate the tree structure of the input.

Usage:
	parser [<input>] [<output>]
	
Each of the input and output can be filenames, which sets the input or output to the corresponding file, or "-" or empty, which sets the input to stdin or output to stdout.

Known issues:
	* Given input consisting of several functions and declarations, only prints the first function or declaration
