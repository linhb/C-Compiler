******************************** CSCI E-295 Final Project ****************************************

The source code in this directory compiles into a compiler for a subset of the C language. This subset includes most arithmetic and logical operations, as well as functions and interactive system calls. It supports arrays and pointers to a limited extent. Please refer to spim_input.c and spim_output.s for a sample input and output.

Usage: 

./compiler <input file> <output file> <SPIM output file>

Replace first parameter with - for stdin; replace second or third parameter with - for stdout.
